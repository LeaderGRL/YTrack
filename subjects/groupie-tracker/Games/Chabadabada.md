## Objective

The objective of this game is to create a web application where users can play a game where a random word is given to a user and the user have to find the title of a song that contains the word. The game will keep track of the user's score and display it at the end of the game.

## Instructions

1. The game gives a random word to the user.
2. The user must find a song that contains the word.
3. A feedback must be given to the user to know if the answer is correct or not.
4. The song is played when the user gives an answer.
5. The game must keep track of the user's score and display it at the end of the game.

## Bonus
- Make a microphone feature where the user can sing the song instead of typing the title. The application will use an API to recognize the song and check if the answer is correct.
